description: WOMAN WILL NEVER BE GREEK ENOUGH FOR HUSBAND'S FAMILY
---

# Article

DEAR ABBY: I married a Greek man whose family never accepted me. Being young and **naive**, I tried everything to fit in, **converting** from Catholicism to the Greek Orthodox **faith**, attending all family functions, including them in our lives. It was never enough.

&#x20;My husband and I traveled to Crete with his family to visit his **relatives** there, and some **extended family** members **refused to** share the dinner table with me because I was not Greek. One of those family members was a priest!

&#x20;Our daughter, "Athena," was born four years later. What **broke the camel's back** for me was a Christmas dinner when she was 6. My father-in-law gave cards with $100 to all the grandchildren of Greek **heritage**. Athena received nothing and cried for hours wanting to know why her grandfather didn't love her. My husband just tried to stay **neutral**.

Abby, how far should someone have to go to fit in with their husbandâ€™s family?
