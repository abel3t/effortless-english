DEAR ABBY:

My husband, "James," and I have been married only three years. We are both **in our 20s**. Everything is really great between us -- except our sex life. **As far as he is concerned** that's fine, too, but I am not **satisfied**. It may seem **odd** to hear the female wants to have sex more **frequently** than a young and healthy **male**, but that's **the case** in our relationship.

Abby, I **work with the public** and I get frequent **remarks** about what a beautiful woman I am. This makes it hard for me to believe that I don't attract him at all. I have **expressed** many times that I wish we were more **intimate**. I have even expressed it to him in more than one letter, hoping **to reach him**.

I am **at a total loss** as to how to make him realize how important this is to me. Is there something wrong with my body? I just don't know who **to turn to** for advice on this subject. Please help me.

\-- **SHORT ON** INTIMACY IN OHIO
