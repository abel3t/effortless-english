# Article

DEAR ABBY:

I am a single woman in my early 30s who has never been married. I recently fell in love with a wonderful man **with whom** I spend a great deal of time. He is **unaware** of the **intensity** of my feelings, and I'm afraid of telling him out of **fear of rejection**.

There are a couple of additional **concerns**: He is 15 years my **senior** and a medical doctor. I am a social worker in a lower **economic class**. In addition, we are of different religions, but we have similar spiritual beliefs and **values**. He is also my co-worker.

I am very interested in **pursuing a deeper relationship** with this man, but would like to hear your advice first. Thank you for your **thoughts** on this.

\-- **LONGING FOR** MORE IN CHICAGO
