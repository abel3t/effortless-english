# Article

DEAR ABBY:

Twenty years ago, my sister and I bought a business from our mother. We all love and respect one another and get along well. We will be finished **paying off** the business in two years.

Our problem: Mom, who is now 77, still **draws a salary** from us **above and beyond** the payment for the business. Her **workload** has **lessened** greatly, as it should. She could do all of her work in one day and lessen the **burden** of her salary. However, she says she'd "go crazy" if she **retired**. We don't want that. She could still come in as often as she wants and do her personal paperwork, banking, letter-writing, reading, etc. These are all things she does at "work" -- **on the clock**.

If we try to discuss this, Mom gets hurt and says, "Just let me know when I'm not worth the money." We don't want to do that. We would hope she would see the fairness of this and suggest it herself.

Business **expenses** are **going through the roof**, and there are **updates** we should make, but we can't do it as long as we are paying Mom at the level we are, **on top of** the money for the **buy-out**.

\-- DAUGHTERS DEAREST
